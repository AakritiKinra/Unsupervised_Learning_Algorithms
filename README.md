### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

A one-stop for unsupervised learning algorithms implemented from scratch in python.

This repository is meant to be a place to study algorithms thoroughly and learn how to implement the theoretical concept. While there are libraries available like scikit-learn which can be used to import implementable models, using them can lead to a gap in understanding of the algorithm itself. 

Take the time, learn your algorithm and code!

### Types of Algorithms

This repository is specfically for unsupervised learning algorithms _only_.
These algorithms are usually used to solve two types of problems:

1. Clustering: Finding structures or patterns in a collection of uncategorized data.

2. Association: Discovering rules which describe relationships in your data.

Some examples of the type of algorithms which can be added here:
- K-means
- Hierarchical clustering
- PCA


### Contribution Guidelines
1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/sashrika15/Unsupervised_Learning_Algorithms/issues) with details about the algorithm you are implementing.
2. Clone the master repository
```
git clone https://github.com/sashrika15/Unsupervised_Learning_Algorithms.git
```
2. Create your own branch

```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

3. On your branch, create a folder with the name of your algorithm and code!
4. Don't forget to help others out by adding a README.md with details of the algorithm you implemented
4. Create a pull request once you're done
